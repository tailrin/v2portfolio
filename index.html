            <h3>Solver of puzzles, slayer of conundrums.</h3>
            <p>I have an inherent love of deductive logic and distaste for an unsolved puzzle.  Programming is logic given form and function. In my humble opinion, nothing is more beautiful than well-constructed logic in action. I stumbled across a script when I worked for Apple and was able to break it down into its component parts to figure out what it did. From there I started modifying it to make it do different things. Thus began my love affair with programming. And yes my wife is jealous.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not solving puzzles I am spending time with my beautiful wife and three children. I love to play board games with my ten year old and help her with her homework. I also love to play on the floor with my one year old twins. As a family, we love to spend time in the great outdoors. We love hiking and camping. </p>
            <p>As a programmer, I love the dynamic of working in a team. Merging disparate coding styles is a challenge no one who calls themselves a slayer of conundrums could pass up. The group dynamic of balancing each others strengths and weaknesses is a marvelous challenge in and of itself.</p>
